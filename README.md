### ***Idea***

The main idea is to help developers when managing and assigning objects IDs when working on several extensions at same time with multiple developers.

Every partner / customer / developer should have control over created objects in order to avoid repeating same number on different extensions. With **EXM** (**EX**tension **M**anager) I'll try to easily assign objects IDs automatically and give to the developer a general view of AL developments.

The app manages 2 types of AL extensions:

- Internal
  - Extensions developed per partners with the aim of selling on the app store or to several customers.
- External
  - Extensions developed only for an specific customer (formerly a customer project).
